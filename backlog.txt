Pentatonic Warfare FE BACKLOG

Main Implementation
1.Implement Musician List
    Used to view managed musicians and to select band members.
    List of musicians displaying basic data like instrument, rarity, genre and level
    Optionally clickable, click function depends on parent component
2.Start Battle with musician selection
3.Add Rarity to Musician objects


2. Remove redundancy from be-service
    Most functions here are written to parse 1 object or an array of objects
    and the code for these 2 options is written twice, and this can be fixed
    with recursion (take isValidMusicianObj as an exampl)

3. Optimise error catching in be-service and ls-service
    Read functions, check types, standardise error msgs
