Pentatonic Warfare FE BACKLOG

Main Implementation
1.Implement Musician List
    Used to view managed musicians and to select band members.
    List of musicians displaying basic data like instrument, rarity, genre and level
    Optionally clickable, click function depends on parent component
2.Start Battle with musician selection
3.Add Rarity to Musician objects

Optimisations and Order
1. create a component to substitute ion-cards because these are used to display info for:
    techniques, musicians in battle, musicians in account tab and account details.
    It should have many inputs:
        a. border colour (string hex), 
        b. clickable (true/false) to give it click animations and events
        c. Title (Musician.lvl, Account name, Technique name)
        d. Content (This bottom row should be a ng-content type of thing to write icons and other fancy stuff)
        e. Img Url
        f. Genre
        (added index and id inputs to return discernable event values)


2. Remove redundancy from be-service
    Most functions here are written to parse 1 object or an array of objects
    and the code for these 2 options is written twice, and this can be fixed
    with recursion

3. Optimise error catching in be-service and ls-service
    Read functions, check types, standardise error msgs
